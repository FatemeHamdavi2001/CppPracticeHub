## C++ Intermediate Projects Hub

This repository includes my **intermediate-level C++ projects** designed to improve my skills through real-world logic, structured code, and modular design using functions.

Each project here is more complex than basic exercises and focuses on solving practical problems using clean and maintainable code.

## What's Included?

| File Name               | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| date_validator.cpp      | Validates a full date (day, month, year), including leap year and day checks.|
| DigitalClock.cpp        | Simulates a real-time digital clock from 00:00:00 with live updates every second. Uses modular functions for time display and increment, handles time overflow (seconds â†’ minutes â†’ hours), and clears console screen for smooth output. Compatible with Windows (uses Sleep and system("cls")). |
| calculator_menu.cpp  | A menu-driven calculator implementing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power (a^b), factorial, and exit option. Uses modular functions and input validation. |

*More projects coming soon...*

## Goals

- Apply C++ knowledge in solving practical programming challenges  
- Strengthen understanding of **functions**, **modularity**, and **input validation**  
- Prepare for building full-featured applications in the future  
- Build a solid portfolio of real projects

---

## Technologies

- Language: C++ (Standard: C++17)  
- Concepts used: Functions, Conditionals, Logical Operators, Modular Code  
- Platform-specific: Windows console for DigitalClock (Sleep and system calls)

---

## Features & Techniques

### DigitalClock.cpp
- Real-time simulation of clock with 1-second interval updates using `Sleep(1000)`  
- Modular code: separate functions for displaying time and updating time variables  
- Time overflow management: seconds roll over to minutes, minutes to hours, hours reset after 24  
- Console screen clearing for smooth, flicker-free output using `system("cls")` on Windows  
- Uses `<iomanip>` for formatted output (leading zeros)  
- Demonstrates basics of event loops and real-time programming in console apps

---

## Structure

Each project is placed in a modular way with:  
- Clear file names  
- Proper documentation and comments  
- Ready to extend with more features  

---

## Coming Up Next

- Bank account manager  
- Mini calculator with history  
- Student grading system  
- File-based user login/register  
... and more to come!
